New in 1.10:

* reduce fragmentation of large blocks by trying to split blocks that are a
  multiple of the allocation size. Also use a best-fit instead of first fit
  strategy when allocating from MAXLIST. (J. Michael German)
* Add rds_maxblock(), which checks if an allocation of the requested size has
  a chance on succeeding.
* switched rds_free code from doing a full coalesce scan to a short test
  whether we can merge with the next block. The full coalesce was a hack
  introduced in v1.7 to work around RDS fragmentation issues.

New in 1.9:

* Fixed building with newer autotools.

New in 1.8:

* Corrected test for fdatasync.
* Don't use locally defined extern int errno, but include <errno.h>.
* Make sure we correctly zero out some memory before using it.
* Pass an actual struct iov to readv/writev instead of a homegrown struct
  that might not match what readv/writev are expecting.

New in 1.7:

* automake 2.5x.
* Allow for more efficient writev usage by using UIO_MAXIOV.
* Avoid writing uninitialized memory to the logfile.
* Valgrind caught a test in rvm_unmap that depended on an uninitialized
  variable.

New in 1.6:

* Fixed stray fsync calls when using partitions on BSD platforms.

New in 1.5:

* Fixed shared library build breakage.

New in 1.4:

* Fixed <sys/time.h> vs. <time.h> confusion.
* Fixed off by one bug in the RVM error table.
* Applied Mac OS X (Darwin) patches from Timothy Wood.

New in 1.3:

* Applied RedHat build patches from Bruce Guenter.
* Merged debian packaging.
* Correctly using MAP_FIXED argument for anonymous mappings.

New in 1.2:

* Added rvm_release_segment() to libseg to free a loaded segment.
* Cleaning up initialized memory mappings in rds_zap_heap.
* Correctly linking librdslwp from the lwp compiled objects.
* Updated package descriptions & building against lwp-1.5.

New in 1.1:

* Fixed the RVM_EOFFSET bug.

New in 1.0:

* Fixed alignment problems on sparc32 platforms (Shafeeq).
* Extracted RVM out of the main Coda source tree.
* Using an automake/autoconf/libtool build environment.
* Creating shared libraries.
* Fixed some bugs in the testprograms.
* Reduced rvm locking overhead by about 50%.
