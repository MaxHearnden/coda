Basic Installation
==================

Obtaining the sources
---------------------

The sources can be downloaded from:
    ftp://ftp.coda.cs.cmu.edu/pub/coda/src/rpc2-x.x.tar.gz

Or obtained from the anonymous CVS repository:

You need to have automake, autoconf, and libtool installed on your system in
order to set up the build environment. Known versions that work are automake
1.7 and 1.8, autoconf 2.52 and 2.59, and libtool 1.5.2.  Perl is
required to build RPC2.  GNU Make is required to build rpc2 (in
particular, the rules for running rp2gen in fail/); 3.80 is known to
work.

    $ cvs -d':pserver:anonymous@coda.cs.cmu.edu:/coda-src' login
    Password: <return>
    $ cvs -d':pserver:anonymous@coda.cs.cmu.edu:/coda-src' co rpc2
    $ cd rpc2
    $ sh bootstrap.sh

From here the everything is identical to (but possibly more up-to-date than)
using the tarball from the Coda ftp site.

Prerequisites
-------------

While RPC2 does not need GNU readline, if readline is present the
'filcon' program will be built.

Configuring
-----------

Run the ./configure script. The default installation path is /usr/local, but
this can be modified by using the --prefix option.

Building and installing
-----------------------

$ make
$ make install

*note: When you encounter any makefile errors, try to build using GNU make.
    (which is commonly installed as gmake on BSD systems)


Building various packages
=========================

Building RedHat rpm packages;
- First run configure which creates suitable rpm-spec files in the pkgs
  directory.
- If you have made local modifications create a new tarball by running
  make dist (and preferably modify the Release field in the spec file).
- Copy the source tarball to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES.
- Run 'rpm -ba pkgs/rpc2.spec' to build the rpc2 rpms.

  - 'rpm -ba pkgs/rpc2-dos.spec' will cross-compile for dos.
  - 'rpm -ba pkgs/rpc2-nt.spec' will cross-compile for win32, and create a zip
    archive containing .dll's in /tmp.

Building FreeBSD or NetBSD packages;
- Run 'pkgs/pkg-bsd.sh <version> FreeBSD|NetBSD'
- A tarball named pkg-rpc2-<version>-<bsd>.tgz is created which can be
  extracted into the ports/pkgsrc tree.

Building Debian/GNU Linux packages;
- Use debuild, which comes with the devscripts package.
- For cross-compiling, install dpkg-cross, binutils-multiarch and a suitable
  cross-compiler (f.i. one from www.emdebian.org), and use debuild -a<arch>.
