New in 1.13:

* Fixed crash when an expired connection receives a NAK.
* Increased lower bound on retransmission time to 300ms.

New in 1.12:

* Fixed gcc-3.0 compiler warnings.
* Added support for libreadline v4.2.
* Stricter prototyping for callback functions.
* Fixed the very infrequent SFTP_SendResponse crash.

New in 1.11:

* Applied MacOS X (Darwin) patches from Timothy Wood.
* Keeping track of current fd offset in sftp to allow non-multirpc transfers
  from/to a non-seekable fd (eg. stdout).

New in 1.10:

* Fixed NULL pointer dereference when rpc2 packet tracing is enabled.

New in 1.9:

* Corrected errors in libfail's delay filter code.
* Added latency delay to libfail.
* Merged debian packaging stuff.
* Using same version number for all libraries to allow multiple versions
  of the libraries to coexist.
* Allow for sending and receiving SFTP packets through the RPC2 socket when
  the user has not specified a specific SFTP port.
* Fixed connection and packet leaks when unmarshalling a request fails.
* Changed RPC2_setip to accept struct in_addr instead of hostname.

New in 1.8:

* Socketlistener got stuck on clocktick wakeups.

New in 1.7:

* Don't let socketlistener select on errors when it is unwilling to handle
  the case when there is an error on the filedescriptors.

New in 1.6:

* Fixed the binding to specific addresses by using RPC2_setip before
  calling RPC2_Init.
* Cross compilation stuff for the Itsy (SA-1100). (Jason Flinn)
* Corrected byteswapping of incoming/outgoing packets on Itsy's. (Jason Flinn)
* Linking against the updated liblwp in lwp-1.5.
* Limit the size of piggybacked sftp data to the requested sftp_maxpacketsize
  to avoid ip-layer fragmentation.
* Fixed the RPC2_NOBINDING bug which showed up in clog.

New in 1.5:

* Fixed a bug where we always decoded packets when receiving, even when
  the sessionkey was not yet negotiated.

New in 1.4:

* Limited support to do sftp transfers from the stdin/stdout.
* Added flag enable the connection reaper on a per program basis, too many
  rpc2 applications broke.

New in 1.3:

* Only reaping dead server connections.

New in 1.2:

* Avoid iopen dependency on systems that don't have that syscall.
* Reaping dead connections.

New in 1.1:

* Fixed problems with sftp transfers when the fd is shared.
* Avoiding a double free of a packet buffer on diskerrors.
* Added RPC2_SetTimeout so that applications can control the per-RPC timeout
  on a connection. (Dushayanth Narayanan)

New in 1.0:

* Extracted RPC2 out of the main Coda source tree.
* Using an automake/autoconf/libtool build environment.
* Creating shared libraries.
