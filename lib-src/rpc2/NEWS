New in 1.6:

* Fixed the binding to specific addresses by using RPC2_setip before
  calling RPC2_Init.
* Cross compilation stuff for the Itsy (SA-1100). (Jason Flinn)
* Corrected byteswapping of incoming/outgoing packets on Itsy's. (Jason Flinn)
* Linking against the updated liblwp in lwp-1.5.
* Limit the size of piggybacked sftp data to the requested sftp_maxpacketsize
  to avoid ip-layer fragmentation.
* Fixed the RPC2_NOBINDING bug which showed up in clog.

New in 1.5:

* Fixed a bug where we always decoded packets when receiving, even when
  the sessionkey was not yet negotiated.

New in 1.4:

* Limited support to do sftp transfers from the stdin/stdout.

* Reaping dead connections.

New in 1.1:

  on a connection. (Dushayanth Narayanan)

New in 1.0:

* Extracted RPC2 out of the main Coda source tree.
* Using an automake/autoconf/libtool build environment.
