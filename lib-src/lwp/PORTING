Some quick notes related to porting LWP to new platforms.

    src/process.ss
	Support switching process stacks.

    src/lwp.c
	The lwp_stackbase is terribly dependent on how a process's memory is
	laid out. i.e. What address ranges are used by dynamic libraries,
	memory mapped files, the process stack, the process text and data
	segments etc.

Shared libraries are tested to work for i386, mips, and sparc platforms. They
might work for all platforms. The common problem is that either entry into
savecontext or when savecontext calls back to the C-code, a segfault occurs.
This is caused by mixing of PIC with non-PIC (position independent code).

If 'testlwp-static 1' works, but 'testlwp 1' does not, check gcc -S output
for: "void call(void (*fn)(void)) { fn() };", and fiddle a bit with the
process.S assembly.
