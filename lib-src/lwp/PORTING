Some quick notes related to porting LWP to new platforms.

    src/process.ss
	Support switching process stacks.

    src/lwp.c
	The lwp_stackbase is terribly dependent on how a process's memory is
	laid out. i.e. What address ranges are used by dynamic libraries,
	memory mapped files, the process stack, the process text and data
	segments etc.
