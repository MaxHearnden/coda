  The original design and implementation of LWP was done by Larry Raper.

  The first versions of LWP were operational in early 1984. Since then
  LWP has been and is being used by several groups both inside and
  outside Carnegie Mellon University. This makes it somewhat difficult
  to create a consistent list of others who have contributed, ported,
  and patched their way through LWP over the years. It would probably
  make a nice project for a history grad student.
